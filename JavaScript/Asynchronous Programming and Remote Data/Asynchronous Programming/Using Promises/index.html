<!-- 
  PROMISES: a promise is an intent to do something (such as provide data) at a future time and it does not garantee succes or failure

  STAGES OF PROMISE:
    1) PENDING: Underlying asynch code hasn't produced any result yet and is in processing
      - after Pending state, it will be either failed or fulfilled
          2) FAILED(rejected): error was observed which led to a failed outcome
          3) FULFILLED(resloved): succcessful and no errors where observed

  Promises do not block the code and we can work with asynch        

  Promise uses 'then', which updates us the output of the promise
      Promise
            .then(result => showResult(result))
            .then(out => showResult(out)) ----------- we can add mulitple 'then' which will execute in the order of expression
            .catch(error => handleError(error))
