          A popular misconception developed among viewers of the show that the
          show-runners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss had rushed the making of the
          final season so that they could move on to make a Star Wars project
          for Disney. While they did have several Star Wars movies planned at
          the time of the airing of Season 8, Benioff and Weiss have stated that
          their plans for the remainder of Game of Thrones (ending with Season
          8) were already mapped out in 2013, long before Disney approached them
          (who were still busy setting up Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force
          Awakens (2015) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) at the time).
          Also, their Star Wars project was only due to come out in 2022, and
          since the show wrapped filming in 2018, the production tables of both
          series were not even remotely overlapping. The shorter number of
          episodes in Season 8 notwithstanding, the production of these final
          six episodes took twice as much time as a regular old ten-episode
          season, so the production wasn't even expedited. On top of that, a few
          months after the show aired its final episode, Benioff and Weiss chose
          to sign a hundred-million dollar deal with Netflix that forced them to
          withdraw from the Star Wars project, citing that they didn't have time
          to do justice to both deals - indicating that the Star Wars project
          wasn't on high priority for them in the first place.
